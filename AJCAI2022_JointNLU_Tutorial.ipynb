        "*   For the **span-based slot F1/precision/recall**, a span (sometimes called a chunk) refers to a sequence of words labelled from the same meta-class of the slot, e.g., the labeling of `B-city I-city I-city` across three words is a span of meta-class slot `city`. A slot span is correct only if it is an exact match of the corresponding ground truth slot span. Thus, we can define at the span level that: the **precision** is the percentage of slot spans found by the NLU model that are correct, i.e., # of slot spans correctly detected (TP) / # of total slot spans detected (TP+FP); the **recall** is the percentage of slot spans present in the corpus that are found by the NLU model, i.e., # of slot spans correctly detected (TP) / # of total slot spans (TP+FN).

It consists of 45K utterances from 12K conversations from the chat logs of 1.9K completed Dota 2 matches. Unlike the common sentence-level toxic language detection dataset, CONDA provides dual-level annotation that enables **joint intent classification and slot filling** analysis (borrowed from the joint NLU domain) to pursue better toxic language detection. Thus, we can directly apply jointBert to CONDA for toxic language detection, utilizing their dual-level annotation."
