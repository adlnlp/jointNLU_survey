## A tutorial based on our survey paper

Where is Natural Language Understanding in 2023?

# The tutorial

When a human speaks to a machine how does the latter elicit meaning from the communication? This is an important AI task as it enables the machine to construct a sensible answer or perform a useful action for the human. Meaning is represented at the sentence level, identification of which is known as intent detection, and at the word level, a labelling task called slot filling. This dual level joint task requires innovative thinking about natural language and deep learning network design and as a result many approaches have been tried. 

In this tutorial we will discuss how the joint task is set up and introduce some NLP and Deep Learning basics. We will cover the datasets, experiments and metrics used in the field. We will describe how the machine uses the latest NLP and Deep Learning techniques to address the task, including recurrent and non-recurrent (attention based Transformer) networks and pre-trained models (e.g. BERT). We will then look in detail at a network that allows the two levels of the task to explicitly interact to boost performance. We will do a code walk through of a Python notebook for this model and attendees will have an opportunity to do some light coding tasks on this model to further their understanding.

Traditionally the two tasks have been addressed independently. More recently joint models that                       address the two tasks together have achieved state-of-the-art performance for each task and have shown there exists a strong                                 relationship between the two. In this survey, we bring the coverage of methods up to 2021 including the many applications of deep                             learning in the field. As well as a technological survey, we look at issues addressed in the joint task and the approaches designed to                       address these issues. We cover datasets, evaluation metrics, and experiment design and supply a summary of reported performance on the                       standard datasets.},
